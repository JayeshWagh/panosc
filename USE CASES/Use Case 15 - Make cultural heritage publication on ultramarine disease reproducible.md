Use Case 15 – Make cultural heritage publication on ultramarine disease reproducible
=========================================================	
The scientist involved, Alessa Gambardella, sees that the “EOSC will offer cultural heritage institutions a platform for sharing collections-based data, which will enable epidemiological studies related…to any degradation phenomena, or conditions-based inquiries” helping to answer questions that reach beyond that possible with the relatively small datasets acquired in a single collection or site. In order to achieve this she would like to make all aspects of her publications open and reproducible including the data analysis.
The goal is to make the data available with the Jupyter Python notebooks to analyse the data.

Use Case Action Flow
------	
* Upload raw and processed data to ESRF data repository + mint DOI
* Prepare Python notebooks to download data and process them
* Upload Python notebooks to data repository
* Write documentation

Description of needs
------	
*Uploading data to data repository
*Writing and testing Jupyter notebooks

Impact from the implementation
------	
Reproducible publication with analysis notebooks.

Generalisation of the use case
------	
This is an example of what other publications could do to provide notebooks with their publication to reproduce the results.
