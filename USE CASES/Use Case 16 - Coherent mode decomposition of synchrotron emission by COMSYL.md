Use Case 16 - Coherent mode decomposition of synchrotron emission by COMSYL

The radiation emitted by new low emittance storage rings, like the EBS at ESRF, is much more coherent than in the old synchrotrons. This is of great interest for many experimental techniques like X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, coherent diffraction imaging, or ptychography. Perhaps the most efficient way to describe the partial coherence characteristics of a beam is to use the coherent mode. COMSYL [1,2] is a code developed at ESRF, that allows, without approximations, to calculate the coherent modes of an undulator beam. This code is of interest for beamline designers, as it proposes a new accurate way to treat the coherent properties of the beam [3], and has been used for simulations at ESRF beamlines [4]. It also helped to predict new features found in the synchrotron beams, such as singularities and vortices in the speckled cross-spectral density [5].
