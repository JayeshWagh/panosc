Use Case 6 – Analysing 2D uXRD maps for cultural heritage samples (ESRF)
=========================================================

Improving the efficiency of 2D uXRD experiments (many different users, a possible regular beamtime, remote experiment), would help to have a dedicated Jupyter notebook for data processing. It would be a good way:

*To save time;
*To record which map has already been processed and how;
*To have a coherent data processing between users and between sessions, and also for possible users who would like to reuse data after the embargo period.

Use Case Action Flow:
------
*Extract data
*Radial integration
*Combine maps

Impacts from the implementation:
------
The goal will be to perform 2D µXRD maps on painting fragments from various historical paintings in a reproducible and user friendly manner for non-expert synchrotron users.

Generalisation of the use case:
------
It could be useful for any 2D µXRD mapping experiments.

Partners:
------
All synchrotrons doing 2D µXRD mapping of heterogeneous samples e.g. Petra-II DESY, DIAMOND, ELETTRA, SOLEIL

Resources:
------
h5py, pyFAI, Jupyter notebooks
