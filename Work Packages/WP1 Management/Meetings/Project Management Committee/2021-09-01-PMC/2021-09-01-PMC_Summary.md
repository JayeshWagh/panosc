**1. WP5 presentation by Andy and Carsten**

Andy presented some [PowerPoint slides](https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/blob/master/Work%20Packages/WP5%20Virtual%20Neutron%20and%20X-ray%20Laboratory/Documents/Presentations/PaNOSC_WP5_review_20210901.pptx?raw=true) and reminded the attendees of the planned work for the WP5, the main WPs with which is related and its weight in the project (3rd largest WP in the project). Andy also listed the contributions per partner (most partners contribute around 40 PMs except ELI with 12).

Andy continued the presentation listing the objectives of the WP5 according to the proposal, the tasks, deliverables and showed a chart with the upcoming milestones.

Andy highilgihted the WP5 is very ambitius, wanting to link simulation and experimental data together within a simulation framework. 

He also shared his perceived issues for WP5:
* Lack of engagement from the ESRF and plans to recover from it
* Lack of usage of EGI compute resources for the WP5
* Few use cases for Commercial Cloud 
and also what is pending for the remainder of PaNOSC:
* continue engagement in WP5 activities
* ESRF to contribute with workflows and visualisation
* Complete WP5 training material

Andy finished his presentation showing how the effort in WP5 is very well aligned with our plans and thanking Carsten for continuing leading the WP even when he changed employer and could have droped it.

Carsten had a [presentation](https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/blob/master/Work%20Packages/WP5%20Virtual%20Neutron%20and%20X-ray%20Laboratory/Documents/Presentations/PaNOSC_WP5_Review_2021-09-01%20(minimized).pdf) ready and went through the completed items, dashboard, KPIs and partners (with their responsibilities).

Carsten listed the issues affecting the project:
* Service deployment & integration in VISA (for which support from other WPs is requried)
* Integration with WP4 to enable data analysis of simulated data
* Database refactoring / reorganising data and the way it can be accessed
* Comsyl 1D solution

Carsten ended with a review of the partners contribution to the WP5, highlighting the fact that deployment and integration in VISA is very important.

Fabio said that he could attend WP5 meetings to define a use case and then implement it.

Jean-Fran√ßois asked for a presentation to WP6 meeting so WP6 an look at how to deal with simulation services within WP6 (so these services are not run only locally).

Andy shared that WP5 services should be available in VISA.

Thomas reported that McStas simulations have been used in the e-learning platform and reminded everyone that the the platform is still missing Photon and Laser content (it remains a neutron learning site).
