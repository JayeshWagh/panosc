Before the meeting started, Andy explained that a conversation was held with XFEL regarding the contribution/participation to PaNOSC. Andy also reported that that Jana Kolar (CERIC and EB member of PaNOSC) has been appointed Chair of ESFRI.

**1. WP6 presentation by Andy and Ornela**

Andy and Jean-François jointly presented some [PowerPoint slides](https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/blob/master/Work%20Packages/WP6%20EOSC%20Integration/Slides/PaNOSC_WP6_review_20210706.pptx) and highlighted the fact that it is not yet clear what is the EOSC and different stakeholders and projects have differnt views.

The presentation continued highlighting that WP6 is related to many other WPs and has a significant size (originally around 14% but a little bit more after the ESRF made some transfers from other PMs). The overall PMs contribution is 193PMs with EGI and ESRF being the largest contributors. It was noted that ILL and XFEL are not very engaged in the WP as of July 2021.

The presentation moved on into the objectives of WP6, its taks, deliverables and milestones. It was noted that the deliverables were changed in the grant agreement (with respect to the proposal) and that two deliverables are due in November 2021:
* Compute cloud report (describing the technical work required to integrate partner compute resources into the EOSC environment)
* AAI report (presenting the results of the feasibility study (Task 6.4) concerning the PaN AAI integration with EOSC, the result of the collaboration with GÉANT and a demonstration of PaNOSC services with EOSC AAI) 

The next point to be covered was the inventory of what needs to be sustained, future funding available/not available for Research Infrastructures and issues that WP6 has, in particular:
* Lack of engagement from some partners
* AAI adoption by all partners
* Lack of utilisation of EGI resources
* Data Transfer (still not clear whether OneData can deliver)
* Few use cases for commercial cloud

The meeting ended with a description of EOSC issues, spending/contribution by partners and what needs to be delivered for the remainder of PaNOSC.
