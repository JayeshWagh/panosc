PaNOSC USE CASES

Use Case 1 – EuXFEL Data in NeXus Golden Standard
=========================================================	
There were great efforts put in the last two decades in the research community to elaborate a common standard for high data-rate macromolecular crystallography (HDRMX). This agreed “Gold Standard” builds on the NeXus/HDF5 NXmx application definition and the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr) imgCIF/CBF dictionary, and it is compatible with major data-processing programmes and pipelines. Here we demonstrate the EuXFEL data packed into a NeXus file, which is fully compliant with the Gold Standard by design, since it is built directly from HDRMX NeXus definitions. We use open-source software developed both by community (cctbx) and in-house (extra-data).

Use Case 2 – Operation of X-ray gas monitors at the European XFEL
=========================================================	
X-ray gas monitors (XGMs) are operated at the European XFEL for non-invasive single-shot pulse energy measurements and average beam position monitoring. They are used for tuning and maintaining the self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) operation and for sorting single-shot experimental data according to the pulse-resolved energy monitor data. The XGMs were developed at DESY based on the specific requirements for the European XFEL. In total, six XGM units are continuously in operation.

Here, the main principle and experimental setup of an XGM are summarized, and the locations of the six XGMs at the facility are shown. Pulse energy measurements at 0.134 nm wavelength are presented, exceeding 1 mJ obtained with an absolute measurement uncertainty of 7–10%; correlations between different XGMs are shown, from which a SASE1 beamline transmission of 97% is deduced. Additionally, simultaneous position measurements close to the undulator and at the end of the tunnel are shown, along with the correlation of beam position data simultaneously acquired by an XGM and an image.
