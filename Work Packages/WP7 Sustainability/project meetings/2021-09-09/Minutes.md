### Minutes
#### 1.Task 7.2 costs and metrics of the PaNOSC-D7.2 Metrics and costs of the PaNOSC (update on progress)

Ornela de Giacomo states that there is no much progress in the text of the deliverable. Ornela asks to Teodor if ELI is still willing and available for working on the metrics, Teodor states that he will prepare some first draft metrics analysis for next week. Ornela asks Teodor if he has all the costs sheets and the documents related in order to support on the metrics analysis, Teodor will check and in case will ask for them.
Ornela states that we didn´t went through the costs lines and fields of the cost sheet of CERIC to verify them with Roberto Pugliese, he states that he is available for it and Ornela asks to provide his availability to discuss them.

#### 2.Task 7.3 Business models of the PAN EOSC:
Ornela explains that Rudolf Dimper proposed to rely the sustainability on LEAPS and LENS and this was discussed with the executive board (EB). The EB proposes to have a wider approach, that includes a better connection with EOSC for the sustainability and to not limit it on LEAPS and LENS future plan and funding. Ornela also explains that there will be a presentation during ERF General Assembly on PaNOSC sustainability, where Andy Gotz will have an introductory talk and she will present some of the challenges ahead of us, based on a presentation already discussed during a previous WP7 meeting. In that presentation it is  proposed that PaNOSC outputs should be focused as outputs that can be taken in by all PaN Facilities in order to be sustainable in the long term. Moreover there will be a presentation on PaNOSC outputs in the next LEAPS and LENS General Assembly and Andy Gotz will report on them. There are no participants from ESRF in this meeting so no further details are available.

#### 3.Update on EOSC TF “Funding models for EOSC” 
Ornela explains that there is a Coordination and support action project in preparation by the EOSC Association (EOSC-A), with the following objective:
“Support the development of an effective pan-European cooperation framework and a thriving EOSC ecosystem in which stakeholders from all parts of the European Research Area pull together in a strategic and coordinated manner to ensure the achievement of the EOSC Partnership objectives.” 
One of the expected outcomes as specified in the work programme is that “effective business models are defined to guarantee future sustainability and development of EOSC as a key element of open science”. However, the description of this activity in the proposal, where it was addressed as WP5, sustainability, has little relation with the expected outcome in terms of sustainability.  This was raised to the EOSC-A president and the TF proposed a different structure for the WP, however no answer was received. Considering the context, Ornela proposes not to present her candidature to chair the task force since the conditions for a constructive collaboration are not met, but she will still participate to the task force to represent the PaN facilities point of view and contribute to the development of EOSC.
