### Minutes

#### 1. Task 7.3 Business models - Progress report
Angela presents the advances on the task 7. 3 Business Models: the different values brought by PaNOSC and who will be interested in those values. Thomas points out that one of the values related to the generation of FAIR data can be of more interest for the European Commission. he also points out that the enlargement of the user community is one of the value of most interest for the RIs. Ornela and Angela propose that all the partner will check the values proposed and give feedback on them. 
Rudolf also points out that the language used for the business model could be closer to the scientists and less “business” oriented. Angela states that we can see in the future if we have to change the language according to the stakeholders to whom PaNOSC will be presented, but the business model should have a “business” language.  Jordi agrees that we have to make a difference between the business model preparation and the dissemination of it, and that the language eventually can be changed for the dissemination. Ornela states that we can maintain the language at the moment for the business models (task 7.3) and decide in the future to eventually use a different language in the Sustainability Plan task 7.4). 


#### 2.	WP7 KPIs
Ornela presents the KPIs for WP7 proposed by Jordi, after a discussion with Expands on possible joint KPIs. Ornela states that the maybe we cannot consider the KPIs as key performance indicators or just performance indicators. 
Jordi  explains that the KPIs proposed are focused on the liaison with EOSC, which is one of the aspects WP7 should cover and that overlaps with the activities of Expands. Ornela proposes to adopt them as performance indicators, but not key. Jordi asks to think about indicators related to the sustainability, Ornela highlights the difficulty to relate the KPIs to the sustainability at the moment, as the results of the work of the sustainability WP will be evident after the end of the project. 
Rudolf states that WP 7 should measure the sustainability of the services developed by PaNOSC in the future, therefore WP7 should analyse the KPIs used by all the WPs and see if they are on the right direction to ensure the sustainability. 


#### 3. Update on latest activities: meeting with Expands; feedback on Iron Lady document
Ornela  informs about the participation in the 2nd ESFRI RIs-EOSC Workshop "Research Infrastructures shaping EOSC" in October 6-7, where Andy Gotz and Ornela moderated sessions on FAIR+R and RD presented the EOSC Cluster projects joint paper. Later in October (19-22) there was the EOSC Governance Symposium 2020 where the latest outputs from the EOSC Secretariat were presented and discussed. There it was also presented the Iron Lady document and the approach used for the study of the business models. Angela briefly explains this part: two types of business models were shown: the “transaction engine” and the “learning engine” models, but they were not explained in detail, neither how they will be specifically developed. Regarding the EOSC costs, during the symposium it was stated that they will be around 7 million euros per year and that European Commission and member states should sustain those costs, but the methodology used to calculate those costs has not been showed.
Ornela explains that with Expands they have agreed to read the Iron Lady document and see if there are pressing issues to provide feedback upon. The co-chair of the sustainability WG asked for the  feedback in one week (today) but that is not feasible. There will be a meeting on Thursday November 5th to discuss if there is the need to provide feedback and the main points to highlight, all the WP7 members are invited to take part.
