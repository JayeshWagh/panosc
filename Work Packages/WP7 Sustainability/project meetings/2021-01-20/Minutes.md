### Minutes
#### 1. T 7.4 Report on sustainability: stakeholders consultation with PaNOSC WP leaders: WP4 Sandor Brockhauser and WP8, Florian Gliksohn
Florian Gliksohn presents the considerations related to the training platform (WP8) sustainability and outlines the key questions related to sustainability that have been identified and discussed within WP8 and with WP7 without, at the moment, final conclusions.

He introduces the outputs and added value expected out of the training activities and the training platform in particular. He explains that the training platform was initially expected to be developed mostly to serve the training requirements of PaNOSC. The concept has evolved in two ways: firstly, the platform will also be used by ExPaNDS and will therefore not be branded solely as a PaNOSC platform; furthermore, the ambition is not to restrict the content to training material related to FAIR data management, but to be open to any training content relevant to the PaN community. The platform will include content developed within the platform, but will also have the possibility to index contents hosted by third parties. Florian underlines that, since it will be a PaNOSC-Expands platform, the governance, management and ownership of the platform beyond the timeframe of both projects need to be further defined, as well as its brand.  

According to Florian, the training platform could be accessible from the PaNOSC portal (developed in WP4). The question of whether the platform should be made available to third parties as well, even extra EU, is also discussed. Partners agree that the platform should be as inclusive as possible. Ornela de Giacomo points out that, unlike in the case of the PaNOSC portal, if some facility doesn´t want to contribute, it does not pose a problem of survival of the training platform while, in the case PaNOSC portal, the lack of participation of some facilities can compromise its overall sustainability.

Ornela also highlights that, in the case of opting for a model where there is one or few champions (facilities) that commit to maintain the federated instance, she is not sure how much added value maintaining the training platform for all partners can bring to the facilities/partners in charge. We will have to think on ways of rewarding those that will be in charge of this task. Florian states that, for some partners a learning platform can be needed even internally, and they can profit from this platform to use it also for internal purposes, choosing which content can be shared with everyone or with the personnel/users of the facility, and the PaNOSC training platform would work as an umbrella. For the time being, only a single instance of the platform is being considered; the distributed architecture is being investigated as an optional architecture.

Teodor Ivanoaica gives an example where some content can be private and Florian agrees and states that there can be some capacity developed at central level and other locally, involving partners that don´t have their own learning platform.  Teodor states that for their distributed nature they are considering an approach similar to the PaNOSC portal, with some common general content and the rest of the contents developed locally by and for each facility. He highlights that it would be important to decide the model for the platform, since that is still under discussion. Sandor Brockhauser confirms that in the development of the PaNOSC portal they foresee this kind of approach, with local instances and a federated one, and each partner being free to offer local services in their local instance.

Florian Gliksohn shows the current financial estimation for the maintenance and operation of the training platform and explains how WP8 participants are trying to calculate the scaling for fixed and variable costs. He explains that at the moment they lack of a precise estimation for the costs associated to community building (like costs related to dissemination, promotion, on-boarding, etc.), which should not be underestimated. Florian highlights that the overall costing depends a lot on what capacity is considered for the training platform (how many users can be served simultaneously). 

In the final part of the presentation, Florian shows the key questions around which the sustainability of the platform revoles: the relation between the training platform and the PaNOSC portal developed in Wp4, the unit costs and scaling factors, the sustainability model and the governance. Ornela asks when they think the training portal will be operative, and Thomas replies that the milestone is to have it ready by mid 2021.

Rudolf Dimper states that we have PaNOSC and ExPaNDS projects as drivers to start the process and later maybe other projects to go on with the process and to decide on the economic model. Angela Zennaro states that, even if without precise numbers, possible business model should be considered during PaNOSC project.  Rudolf Dimper considers that during PaNOSC we have to show to the lab managers that the platform is valuable. 

#### 2. T 7.3 Collection on feedback for business models and next steps
After the presentation by Florian, Ornela reminds to everyone that regarding the cost collection (T 7.2), it should be finalized by the end of this month and that we cannot wait longer in order to proceed, otherwise the deliverable may me compromised. 
A deadline will be proposed, after which the cost analysis will start, independently on the number of partners that have completed the cost collection. Of course this may affect the efficiency of the business models, so it should be avoided.

#### 2. T 7.3 Collection on feedback for business models and next steps
#### 3. T 7.1 Stakeholder consultation: collection of feedback for questionnaire proposed by Roberto
Due to the lack of time to discuss all the topics of the agenda Ornela de Giacomo proposes to postpone the topics not covered in the agenda to next week, everyone agrees.
