### Minutes
#### 1. T 7.4 Report on sustainability: stakeholders consultation with PaNOSC WP leaders: WP4 Sandor Brockhauser and WP8, Florian Gliksohn
Florian Gliksohn presents the considerations related to the training platform (WP8) sustainability and how some key questions have been discussed inside the WP and with WP7 without, at the moment, final conclusions. He introduces the expected outputs and the added value of the trainings and the training platform. He explains that although initially the trainings appeared to be mainly focused on data management, with also Expands needing for a training platform, the PaNOSC platform can be open to other kind of trainings interesting for the PaN community. The platform will also have the possibility to index contents hosted by third parties. Florian Gliksohn highlights that since it will be a PaNOSC-Expands platform, responsibilities related to the management of the platform will need to be defined, as well as its brand.
