Folder to collect numbers for the 4 KPIs from each partner:

- KPI 4.1: research institution (partner) offers remote desktop or jupyter notebook service

- KPI 4.2: number of unique users making use of remote desktop or jupyter service

- KPI 4.3: number of experimental techniques supported by the services

- KPI 4.4: number of returning users making use of remote desktop or jupyter service (#)


(#) returning user is a unique user appearing at least twice in the list, but at least on different days


The four numbers, as of May 2021, can be uploaded to this folder in any format, even though
plain text is preferred for me to assemble it for sharing with PMC.
