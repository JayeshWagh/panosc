## Discussions:



Activity report:

OneData pilot: ILL is not available at the moment, looking for an RI with the same storage environment 

Still investigating: access via non root account and mapping of the users 

A meeting took place with CERIC, ILL, EGI and Lukasz Dutka (CYFRONET), new solutions are appearing. Marco will follow up on this. A new meeting will be organised by Andrea.

A solution to collect local RI userid in EDUTeams is possible and would simplify the set up. This solution was already studied by DESY security officers and not retained. 

AAI : documentation on KeyCloack setup will be done based on the ESS experience.

Draft Term of Use for Umbrellaid is ongoing. Introduction of the metadata registration to the management team and Users office. 

CVMFS:  Aidan (ESRF) Stratum0, GCC works, python packages,  single replicate. Use to copy datafile, working on setting up for Conda environment and Debian packages.

Aidan made a presentation of the possible use of CERNVMFS in the PaN context, Ian will put Aidan in contact with STFC expert.
