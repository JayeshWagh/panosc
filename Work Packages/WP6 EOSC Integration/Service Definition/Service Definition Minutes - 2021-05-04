## Discussion

- Shift manager is not necessarily a person, it's more a role to be assigned to a distribution list to share the load
  - manages and ensures tickets are answered within agreed times
  - it's critical to have SLD agreed to for services (rather than SLAs)
- We need to agree on the process (road map) moving forward, now that we have a helpdesk document
