Discussion:
Main discussion revolved around the Agenda topics above, and included the following points:
- How do we co-exist (WP6 and WP7)?
- Helpdesk:
  - we should have a centralised Helpdesk that then distributes the ticket to the relevant RI
  - Discussing model where each RI allocates X number of people, and where each RI manages a specific technical area:
    - example:
      - Storage: ESRF
      - Network: ESS
      - Archive: ELI
      - Other: another RI
      - etc...
  - A dispatching rotating role for 1st level support
  - can we use pan.eu as the central contact email?
  - Helpdesk is a priority to setup
  - Helpdesk should be part of the PanoscPortal (local portal and federated portal)
- In general, we need to quantify the advantages/disadvantages of federated services as a community




For next meeting:
