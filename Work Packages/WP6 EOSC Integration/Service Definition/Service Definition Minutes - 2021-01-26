Update:
- Teodor to present briefly on SLA topic
- Kareem to present briefly on Governance/Sustainability


Discussion:
- Current discussion should also link to EOSC in the future
  - Should also include ExPANDS
- What are the services that we want to provide to our community? 
  - What resources are needed for this? 
  - Who will provide them?
- We need 2 documents: minutes and deliverable document
- Governance:
  - for us, this falls more towards the technical definition that we are interested in. For example, we are concerned with how to run a JupyterHub server
  - other technical issues could be: AAI
  - we should define the services + KPIs, then take/present the results to WP7
  - expanding beyond PaNOSC? 
    - should be managed by WP7
    - will be hard to manage multiple club members
- MOU: is needed between the different RIs to form the basis for a technical standard to follow
- AAI:
  - how much is it used?
  - how is it related to Governance/Sustainability?
  - we should all agree on UmbrellaID as PaNOSC federated access
- Future conclusions should be compiled into delieverable document and added to Github for documentation


Outstanding:
- Definition of Done (DoD): when to know that the work for this workgroup is complete
- no new updates are being added to the Google document at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e9QddP9aPXShK3SMChfp7LfD5xPIDZAGKcl4petAaQE/edit#
- no explicit milestones set 
- allocating topics to members, for presentation
- how to present progress to the rest of the WP6 team
- minutes currently added to a single Google doc. This should be moved to a fortnighly page on panosc Github (this page)
- agreed agendas should be sent prior to the meeting to facilitate more fruitful discussions

For next meeting:
- Deliverables added to document
- Starting point: description of work (Helpdesk)
- AAI: Agree on UmbrellaID for federated access. How should we put this into action?
