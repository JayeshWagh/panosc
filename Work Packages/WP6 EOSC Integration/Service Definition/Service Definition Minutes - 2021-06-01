## Discussion
- the PaN Portal does not exist at the moment within or outside PaNOSC. The EOSCPortal is the closest living/existing implementation of a portal hosting the services
- a discussion of a future PaN Portal is warranted
- for security and data privacy of exposed services, the Sirtfi service can be used in the future (https://refeds.org/sirtfi)

## For next meeting
