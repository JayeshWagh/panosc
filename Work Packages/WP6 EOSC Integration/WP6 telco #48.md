## Discussions:

**General info**

**OneData advancement**



**CVMFS**



**VISA deployment outside of RI infrastructure**



**Deliverables and milestones for 15th of Nov 2021 :**

MS18: Implementation of AAI integration at the level of the Identity providers
MS20: Second release of PaNOSC services, data and resources (work with WP3 and WP4)
Registering a service for a limited set of user initially shouldn't be an issue.

D6.2 : Compute cloud (ELI, EGI, ...)
This report will describe the technical work required to integrate partner compute resources into the EOSC
environment. In particular, the security aspects and organisational challenges will be analyzed.

D6.3 : AAI (ESRF, GEANT, ...)
The report will present the results of the feasibility study (Task 6.4) concerning the PaN AAI integration with EOSC
and the result of the collaboration with GÉANT concerning the implementation. A demonstration of PaNOSC
services with EOSC AAI will be presented.

*Discussion:* 

For declaring a new service to the EOSC portal, does this service need to be open for the community at large? No I could be accepted to have a service limited to a community and if necessary progressively open it larger. 

Would it be possible for EGI to provide VISA for the general scientific community? Andrea: We can study the possibility, we should also discuss limits. Jean-François: we need first to analyse the technical needs for hosting a VISA instance outside a local RI (data access model, software/image provisioning, ...). Rudolf: Could also be an interesting use case for EGI-ACE. Fabio will discuss this option within WP4 and we will re-discuss it during next meeting.
