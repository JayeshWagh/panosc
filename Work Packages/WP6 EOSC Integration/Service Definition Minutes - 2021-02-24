Update:
# Presentation to general WP6 group
  - Provided a presentation for the general WP6 meeting (16/2/2021) showing main points discussed so far in Service Definition meetings
  - Feedback from the presentation:
    - Do we want a general/standard SLA for PaNOSC?
      - Generally speaking, Yes
      - We should create a general process and disseminate to the RIs
    - Services: what are the different types of services available?
      - single vs federated (managed)
      - services managed by non-PaNOSC entities?
      - should add a new slide to the powerpoint presentation on Services
    - Many unanswered questions in the presentation
      - the questions should be extracted, and be presented to PMC for further discussion
      

Discussion:
# Questions for PMC
- Current questinos include:
  - AAI
    - Who has access, and access to what?
    - How to define anonymous access: open access should not mean anonymous access
    - How should access to resources be stated: none, limited, based on RI/affiliation?
  - SLA
    - Should we consider a common set of SLAs for the PaNOSC community?
    - How should SLA violations be treated?
  - Helpdesk
    - Is a local Helpdesk a requirement for joining the EOSC Helpdesk?
    - Is access to a central Helpdesk sufficient at this stage?
    - How will AAI for the central Helpdesk be organised?
  - Governance/Sustainability
    - Should this be centralised or de-centralised model?
      - Managed at the RI level
      - A single entity managing the PaN community RIs input

# Plan working on the standard/general PaNOSC SLA
    
# Plan working on Helpdesk strategy/recommendation
