## Discussions:

**General info**

ILL is back in WP6 and XFEL has joined

**Symposium** and annual meeting

the PaNOSC symposium will take place the 26th of October morning  (2 sessions: use cases and sustainability).
Annual face to face meeting has been postponed until beginning of 2022 due to current European pandemic situation. 

**Deliverables and milestones for 15th of Nov 2021 :**

MS18: Implementation of AAI integration at the level of the Identity providers
MS20: Second release of PaNOSC services, data and resources (work with WP3 and WP4)
Registering a service for a limited set of user initially shouldn't be an issue.

D6.2 : Compute cloud (ELI, EGI, ...)
This report will describe the technical work required to integrate partner compute resources into the EOSC
environment. In particular, the security aspects and organisational challenges will be analyzed.

D6.3 : AAI (ESRF, GEANT, ...)
The report will present the results of the feasibility study (Task 6.4) concerning the PaN AAI integration with EOSC
and the result of the collaboration with GÉANT concerning the implementation. A demonstration of PaNOSC
services with EOSC AAI will be presented.

*Discussion:* 

For declaring a new service to the EOSC portal, does this service need to be open for the community at large? No I could be accepted to have a service limited to a community and if necessary progressively open it larger. 

Would it be possible for EGI to provide VISA for the general scientific community? Andrea: We can study the possibility, we should also discuss limits. Jean-François: we need first to analyse the technical needs for hosting a VISA instance outside a local RI (data access model, software/image provisioning, ...). Rudolf: Could also be an interesting use case for EGI-ACE. Fabio will discuss this option within WP4 and we will re-discuss it during next meeting.

**Ongoing activities**

Cloud procurement: Rudolf has sent again the msg to collect details about user needs, we do have enought information for contacting reight away cloud providers. ELI and ESS will confirm and details their needs this week that we could start this activity.

AAI: ESS are now connected to UmbrellaID (prod and acceptance environment). EGI connection is ongoing (formal process).  UmbrellaID is one of the key use case for EOSC-Future.

OneData and CVMFS has made progress and were briefly discussed, progress on this topics will be presented during next meeting.
