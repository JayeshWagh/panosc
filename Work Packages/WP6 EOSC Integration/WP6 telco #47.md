**Deliverables and milestones :**

MS18: Implementation of AAI integration at the level of the Identity providers
MS20: Second release of PaNOSC services, data and resources (work with WP3 and WP4)
Registering a service for a limited set of user initially shouldn't be an issue.

D6.2 : Compute cloud (ELI, EGI)
This report will describe the technical work required to integrate partner compute resources into the EOSC
environment. In particular, the security aspects and organisational challenges will be analyzed.

D6.3 : AAI (ESRF, GEANT)
The report will present the results of the feasibility study (Task 6.4) concerning the PaN AAI integration with EOSC
and the result of the collaboration with GÉANT concerning the implementation. A demonstration of PaNOSC
services with EOSC AAI will be presented.

Could EGI provide VISA for the general community ? Andrea: yes, but we should provide some limits. Jean-François: we need first to analyse the technical needs for hosting VISA outside a local RI. 
Could also be interesting for EGI-ACE.

**Activities**

Cloud procurement: Rudolf has sent again the msg to collect details about needs, we do have enought information for contacting reight away cloud providers. ELI and ESS will confirm and details their needs this week that we could start this activity.

AAI: ESS are now connected to UmbrellaID (prod and acceptance environment). EGI connection is ongoing (formal process).  UmbrellaID is one of the key use case for EOSC-Future.

OneData and CVMFS has made progress and will be presented during next meeting.
