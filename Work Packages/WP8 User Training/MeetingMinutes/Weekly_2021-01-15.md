## Update on user story workshop

We had a user story workshop last Friday with good discussions, specifically about the different user roles, which got clarified. A set of actionable tasks / user stories are still missing though. Stella has wrapped up the discussion.


## TtT workshop

Unfortunately we had to postpone the first part of the TtT workshop by a week. Danielle is trying to compile a list of participants but she still needs input from various facilities.

ESS Data Systems and Technologies Group is making infrastructure ready for the workshop. 

## Updates from PaNOSC
Stella has started as post doc at ESS and is working with Andrew (ORSO & ESS) on content for reflectometry.


## Updates from ExPaNDS
* Survey will soon be circulated
* A number of workshops are coming up. Thibaud will share the information when he has it. 
* ExPaNDS WP4 has developed a report on reference data sets. Uwe will share it when it's ready. 

## Technical updates
* Keycloack is being rebuilt to make it a proxy for Umbrella and provide federated access. If we are lucky, it will be ready for TtT workshop. 


## AoB
Converting to every 2nd week.
