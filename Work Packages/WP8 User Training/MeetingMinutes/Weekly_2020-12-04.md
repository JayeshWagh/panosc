Summary
=======

1. ExPaNDS-PaNOSC joint KPIs
----------------------------
Jordi and Sophie are asking for joint KPIs
FYI here are the links to our respective sheets:

* [ExPaNDS KPIs](https://tinyurl.com/ExPaNDS-KPIs)
* [PaNOSC KPIs](https://tinyurl.com/PaNOSC-KPIs)

Apparently we already have a joint one: 

1. _# of attendees participating in our training workshops_

In a discussion subsequent to this meeting, Thibaud and Thomas came up with the following joint ones

_# number of users registered in pan-learning.org_
_# number of facilities actively involved in training activities_
_# Data of training material published_

where the last two ones need to be modified so they are quantifiable.

2. Updates on ExPanDs Survey
----------------------------
Thibayd had received feedback from a number of people, but haven't had time to look at it.
