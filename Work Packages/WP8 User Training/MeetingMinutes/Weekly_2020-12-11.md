## 1. ExPaNDS-PaNOSC joint KPIs

Jordi and Sophie are asking for joint KPIs

FYI here are the links to our respective sheets:


* [ExPaNDS KPIs](https://tinyurl.com/ExPaNDS-KPIs)
* [PaNOSC KPIs](https://tinyurl.com/PaNOSC-KPIs)



Apparently we already have a joint one: 



1. _# of attendees participating in our training workshops_


In a discussion subsequent to last meeting, Thibaud and Thomas came up with the following joint ones

2. _# number of users registered in pan-learning.org_ 
2. _# number of facilities actively involved in training activities_
2. _# Data of training material published_

where the last two ones need to be modified so they are quantifiable. 

Thomas has suggested to use #redirects as a measure of how much the training catalogue is used.  HOw may champios

Florian has suggested:
_In addition to #2, you may want to have "number of unique visitors of the portal" as search will be accessible also to non-registered users (at least based on our most recent discussion)._

_Regarding #3, we probably want to be more general and use the notion of 'registered training provider', which could be either a facility, a University, a research organisation, etc. The KPI could then be "number of active training providers" where "active" is understood as any training provider having indexed content in the past X months._

_Regarding #4, we have interest in measuring how much training content is available. We should probably use two metrics:
i. Number of entries in the catalogue (which includes both content available in the e-learning platform and outside content indexed)
i. Number of modules / courses created using the e-learning platform._

_Regarding #2 hours (use) of resources allocated / reserved. How many modules have been completed_

## 5. Discussion of requirements, sustainability, cost of training portal and its components

How do we ensure that training and other services and maintained long term?

At the last meeting Florian presented [these slides](https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/blob/master/Work%20Packages/WP8%20User%20Training/MeetingMinutes/snippets/20201204_PaNOSC_WP8_Sustainability.pptx)

It was agreed that we should push this discussion to WP7 in PaNOSC and management in ExPaNDS and that Thomas and Peter should try to make a cost calculation based on the experience with running e-neutrons.org. 

This has now been discussed at a WP7 meeting. The WP leader said that gathering of sustainability issues / requirements had already been discussed in the last WP7 meeting and that it is the plan to send a questionairie to all wp leaders. Florian has subsequently send a summary of the WP8 position to the WP7 leader incl. that this needs to be discussed jointly with WP4.


## 6. Technical updates
Prototype with nbgrader, Jupyter plugin, integrated into moodle done based on IllumiDesk technology. Still work that needs to be done, particularly on the documetation side.
Aim is now to convert ESS python course based on notebooks to e-learning course. 

AAI is still work in progress. 

## 7. AoB

* EGI plans for best practise training on DMPs. Thibaud will keep us updated.

* Nazar√© will leave SOLEIL and go to the Pasteur Institute. Good Luck to her!
