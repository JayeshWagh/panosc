## 1. ExPaNDS-PaNOSC joint KPIs

Jordi and Sophie are asking for joint KPIs

FYI here are the links to our respective sheets:



* [ExPaNDS KPIs](https://tinyurl.com/ExPaNDS-KPIs)
* [PaNOSC KPIs](https://tinyurl.com/PaNOSC-KPIs)



Apparently we already have a joint one: 



1. _# of attendees participating in our training workshops_


In a discussion subsequent to last meeting, Thibaud and Thomas came up with the following joint ones


2. _# number of users registered in pan-learning.org_
2. _# number of facilities actively involved in training activities_
2. _# Data of training material published_

where the last two ones need to be modified so they are quantifiable.

Florian suggests:
_In addition to #2, you may want to have "number of unique visitors of the portal" as search will be accessible also to non-registered users (at least based on our most recent discussion)._

_Regarding #3, we probably want to be more general and use the notion of 'registered training provider', which could be either a facility, a University, a research organisation, etc. The KPI could then be "number of active training providers" where "active" is understood as any training provider having indexed content in the past X months._

_Regarding #4, we have interest in measuring how much training content is available. We should probably use two metrics:
i. Number of entries in the catalogue (which includes both content available in the e-learning platform and outside content indexed)
i. Number of modules / courses created using the e-learning platform._

5. Discussion of requirements, sustainability, cost of training portal and its components

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the last meeting Florian presented [these slides](https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/blob/master/Work%20Packages/WP8%20User%20Training/MeetingMinutes/snippets/20201204_PaNOSC_WP8_Sustainability.pptx)

It was agreed that we should push this discussion to WP7 in PaNOSC and management in ExPaNDS and that Thomas and Peter should try to make a cost calculation based on the experience with running e-neutrons.org. 

This has now been discussed at a WP7 meeting. The WP leader said that gathering of sustainability issues / requirementd had already been discussed in the last WP7 meeting. Florian has subsequently send a summary of the WP8 position to the WP7 leader.
