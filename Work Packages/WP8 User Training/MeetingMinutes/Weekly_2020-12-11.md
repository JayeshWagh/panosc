1. ExPaNDS-PaNOSC joint KPIs

----------------------------

Jordi and Sophie are asking for joint KPIs

FYI here are the links to our respective sheets:



* [ExPaNDS KPIs](https://tinyurl.com/ExPaNDS-KPIs)

* [PaNOSC KPIs](https://tinyurl.com/PaNOSC-KPIs)



Apparently we already have a joint one: 



1. _# of attendees participating in our training workshops_



In a discussion subsequent to the last meeting, Thibaud and Thomas came up with the following joint ones



2. _# number of users registered in pan-learning.org_

2. _# number of facilities actively involved in training activities_

2. _# Data of training material published_



where the last two ones need to be modified so they are quantifiable.





2. Updates on ExPanDs Survey

----------------------------

Thibaud had received feedback from a number of people, but haven't had time to look at it.





3. Doodles for TtT workshop

   * Thomas has started to write down user stories currently in a [html file](https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/blob/master/Work%20Packages/WP8%20User%20Training/Documents/user_stories.html). It was agreed that this should be converted to Google Docs.

5. Discussion of requirements, sustainability, cost of training portal and its components

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Florian presented [these slides](https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/blob/master/Work%20Packages/WP8%20User%20Training/MeetingMinutes/snippets/20201204_PaNOSC_WP8_Sustainability.pptx)



It was agreed that we should push this discussion to WP7 in PaNOSC and management in ExPaNDS and that Thomas and Peter should try to make a cost calculation based on the experience with running e-neutrons.org. 





6. AoB

------

* Thomas got info from a colleague about [lectures in the African School of Fundamental Physics and Applications](https://www.africanschoolofphysics.org/asp-online-lecture-series/) and [MOOCs in the Nordic Particle Accelerator Project](https://npap.eu/mooc)







Actions

=======

- [ ] *Peter & Thomas* Alternative cost calculation based on e-neutrons.org usage 

- [ ] *Thibaud and Thomas* come up with suggestions for joint KPIs and circulate for review
