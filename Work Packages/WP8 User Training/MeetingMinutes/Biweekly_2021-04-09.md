Technical UPDATES
Kareem - presented the challenges raised by the UmrellaID, after the discussion with Christos Kanelopoulos (GEANT)- UmbrellaID instance (@ESS) is registered to the test servers but no ID could be created.
Stella - presented a modified UI of the portal, using Logo, colours and pictures from PaNOSC GitHUB, a discussion with Nicolleta would be beeded. (we need to know if PaNOSC has some standards in place for UI in terms of colours/logo/pictures - PaN tools and services user experience)
  Stella mentioned tht there are some issues with the chat client. Doru suggested that maybe, to be conssistent and alligned with other WPs, Slack Plugin could be considered as Slack is used also for other PaNOSC Workpackages.
