1. Tasks
--------

* Thomas has reached out to the LENS Working Group 4 for computing and got speaking time and next GA. However, 
  due to the discussion at the annual meeting, e.g. about LEAPS-LENS joint IT group, it may not be the right 
  strategy to focus only on the training portal. Thomas will continue the discussion. The GA is 19 November.
