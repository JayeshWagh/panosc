## Tasks

- [x] *Thomas* Text for circulation TtT
- [x] *Thomas* Requirements for participants in workshop.

Thomas circulated text, which subsuquently has been improved by Nicoletta. I will be used for announcing the workshop on panosc.eu



## Risks

Jordi has assessed risks and asked WP leader to update them. The risks are listed at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gfh0SI8IvM61URcpv2_0FSs3QcOBOXKH/edit#gid=1605852862

Thomas has updated the risks and marked two out of the three WP8 risks as obselete. We should make a new risk assessment for the work package.

Action: Organize risk assessment workshop in Q1 2021

## Joint KPIs

Jordi and Sophie are asking for joint KPIs

FYI here are the links to our respective sheets:

* [ExPaNDS KPIs](https://tinyurl.com/ExPaNDS-KPIs)
* [PaNOSC KPIs](https://tinyurl.com/PaNOSC-KPIs)

Suggestion is to measure on workshops, training catalogue, and e-learning platform

1. Usage of training workshops. Measured on:
   1. number of participants
1. Usage of training catalogue. Measured on:
   1. number of entries
   1. number of unique visitors and visitors?
   1. number of redirects. I.e. how many find training material through the portal.
1. Usage of pan-learning.org. Measured on:
   1. number of registered users
   1. number of completed courses
   1. number of (institutional) content providers
   1. Number of courses / workshops making use of the platform.
