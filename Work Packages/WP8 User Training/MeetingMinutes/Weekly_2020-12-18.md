## Tasks

- [x] *Thomas* Text for circulation TtT

Thomas circulated text, which subsuquently has been improved by Nicoletta. I will be used for announcing the workshop on panosc.eu

- [ ] Thibaud & Nazaré. Collect training material from ExPaNDS partners. 

Survey will be sent by DLS beginning of next year


## Risks

Jordi has assessed risks and asked WP leader to update them. The risks are listed at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gfh0SI8IvM61URcpv2_0FSs3QcOBOXKH/edit#gid=1605852862

Thomas has updated the risks and marked two out of the three WP8 risks as obselete. We should make a new risk assessment for the work package.

Action: Organize risk assessment workshop in Q1 2021

E.g. adoption of platform and sustainability

## Joint KPIs

Jordi and Sophie are asking for joint KPIs

FYI here are the links to our respective sheets:

* [ExPaNDS KPIs](https://tinyurl.com/ExPaNDS-KPIs)
* [PaNOSC KPIs](https://tinyurl.com/PaNOSC-KPIs)

Suggestion is to measure on workshops, training catalogue, and e-learning platform

1. Usage of training workshops. Measured on:
   1. number of participants
       1. From ExPaNDS
       1. From PaNOSC
       1. Other
1. Usage of training catalogue. Measured on:
   1. number of entries
   1. number of unique visitors and visitors?
   1. number of redirects. I.e. how many find training material through the portal.
1. Usage of pan-learning.org. Measured on:
   1. number of registered users
      1. ExPaNDS
      1. PaNOSC
      1. Other
   1. number of completed courses
   1. number of (institutional) content providers
   1. Number of courses / workshops making use of the platform for teaching. 



## TtT workshop
   1. how and who should receive announcement?
   1. Material we can share to interested people (Aljosa)
   1. How many from each partner? Should we make a prioritized list for each partner? What about WP leaders
   1. Preferred platform: Slack, zoom, gather.town
   
 What about observers?
 Action: Ask trainers

## New task & Deliverable on training in data stewardship

*Task 8.4.* _Staff training in data stewardship_ (M25-M32)

D8.1 _Report on lessons learned and future prospects for adopting best practises data stewardship_ (M32)

Consider to do it as part of TtT workshop

Look at material from Brian's ExPaNDS workshop on FAIR data

ELIXIR has links to existing courses, e.g. at DeIC

## Technical updates
Reported that internal milestone for Jupyter integration and associated course is delayed but on track for official milestone

## Sustainability
Agreed that Florian will have call with Ornela (WP7) and Sandor (WP4) about how to proceed with the sustainability question. Florian will invite Thibaud and Sophie from ExPaNDS. 

## AoB
SOLEIL will recruit a person for ExPaNDS and reorganize the work due to Nazare leaving. Thibaud may become less involved in WP8
